# ACADEMIC REPORTING: VOLUNTEERS
#-------------------------------

#-------------------------------
# Recruit enough volunteers to fulfill all our virtual programming.
# How many unique vols were active each term? How many vol roles were active each term (some vols may have more than one role, i.e. co-teach two days)
# Establish a baseline number of volunteers needed per virtual term.

# Increase year-over-year retention rate to 50%
# Note: Pandemic is wildcard - this might not be reasonable  
# Establish a baseline for the average # of terms volunteers serve within one FY

# What is percent of non-native English speaking teachers? What is percent of native English Speaking teachers
# Racial/ethnic diversity - increase % of non-white teachers from Spring 2020 baseline
# What is percentage breakdown by race (fed govâ€™t categories) and by ethnicity (hispanic/latino vs. non-hispanic/non-latino)?
#

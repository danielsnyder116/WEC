#LESSON LEARNED: Sometimes, rather than trying to clean a bunch of messy data sets from start to finish using code, 
# it can be much more efficient to do the basic binning of relevant information manually with human knowledge
# as to how things should be, and then take care of the rest automatically. There was just way too much 
# variation and unclear recording practices from a machine-readable standpoint to try to do it all with code.

#For indicator of new volunteer, newer years started using color or

#team about certain best practices that will help minimize extra work

#I went through all years but seems like SUMMER 2013 is where stars stopped
#*Name -> already in spreadsheet
